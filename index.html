        <p>
            Al-Battani is one of the famous Muslim scholars of mathematics and astronomy studies. He was born in the age
            known as the Golden Age of Islam. With his deep interest in trigonometry - the branch of math that deals
            with three sides and three angles, he found relations between trigonometric signs like sine, cosine, and
            tangent. This led him to determine the changing position of the Sun, Moon, night and, day in a year.
            Al-Battani was born in the year 858 AD at Harran in Turkey. His full name was “Abu Abdullah Muhammad Ibn
            Jabir Al-Battani” and his family is known to have been Sabian – a group of people who worshiped stars. But
            he was a Muslim and believed in only one God. His father was famous for designing scientific instruments.
            This skill of his father helped him to develop instruments used for working on stars and planets. Besides,
            his intelligence in trigonometry also helped him to know the relation between sides and angles of a
            triangle.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="sub_p">
            Among the various contributions of Al-Battani, few are given below. Apart from them he also discovered,
            observed and recorded 489 stars. Besides, he also showed the farthest distance of the Sun from Earth known
            as ‘apogee’.
            Al-Battani determined the solar year, changes in seasons, days and nights due to the revolution of the Sun
            around the Earth in a year, and he also identified a certain number of stars that were not known before. He
            found and named new stars. Ptolemy’s work on the sun’s farthest point was more accurately confirmed by him.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="order">Al-Battani was the first to determine that the solar year is equal to 365 days with an
                additional 5 hours and 45 minutes. This figure of the solar year is in accordance with modern science’s
                calculation of the solar year.</li>
            <li class="order order1">He was first to know and explain the concept of Equinoxes. Equinoxes are times when
                the Sun is over the line at the middle point of Earth when the length of day and night becomes equal.
            </li>
            <li class="order order2">His works on the Sun, Moon, and their yearly changing positions made him arrange
                the Islamic Lunar Calendar – a calendar based on the monthly changing position of the Moon.</li>

        </a>
        <ol>
            <li class="facts facts0">Al-Battani’s expertise on trigonometry made him earn the title of ‘Ptolemy of the
                Arabs’.
            </li>
            <li class="facts facts1">His book Kitab Al-Zig extended and even corrected most of the planetary
                calculations made by Ptolemy. Moreover, he added tables of planets in his book that John Kepler used in
                his works on planetary motions a few centuries later.</li>
            <li class="facts facts2">Al-Battani determined the relation between trigonometric terms and expressed them
                in equations like secant, cosecant, tangent, and cotangent.</li>
            <li class="facts facts3"><span>Trigonometry:</span>Introduced the concepts of sine, cosine, and tangent,
                replacing the Greek chord system with the modern trigonometric system.
            </li>
            <li class="facts facts4"><span>Algebra:</span>Contributed to the development of algebraic methods.</li>

        <p class="final">Al-Battani's accurate observations also allowed him to refine Ptolemy's measurements of the
            axis of the axis. He also made more accurate observations of the equinox (when the sun was right past the
            earth's equator) in early autumn. Through this observation Al-Battani was able to find that in a year there
            were 365.24 days. Al-Battani's freedom in studying ancient texts, especially the work of Ptolemy, which
            encouraged him to find new theories and contribute greatly to trigonometry, was inseparable from the glory
            achieved by the Abbasid dynasty, especially in the era of the Caliph Harun alRasyid (786-809 AD) and his son
            al-Ma'mun (813-833 AD)</p>
